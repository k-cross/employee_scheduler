# Main Possibility Calculation
* Working set of n people
* An ordered set k of m working position sets are subsets of working set
* Combinations for each set l which are subsets of m that may vary in size

## Notes
* May be easier to calculate individual set combinations, then merge with rules

# Possibility Optimization Value Generation
